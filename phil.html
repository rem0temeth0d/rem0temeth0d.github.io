<b>philosophy</b>
<p>I think most people are familiar with works of
Bernard Shaw, to quote a maxim from "Man and Superman": <i> He who can, does.
He who can not, teaches. </i> Surely you have heard it in some form or context.
<p>I feel it is important to toil in the mud, to fail in one's attempts
and to make mistakes, because these experiences ensure that we are moving
forward. Success is not only measured in how many times you meet
your goals, but also by how many times you helped someone else reach their's.
</p>
<p>I feel we have two main obligations in life, one of continuous learning and adapting
  with the changing times and the other of passing on our knowledge and wisdom to our
  successors.

<b> measuring the immeasurable</b>
<p>I am deeply interested in human psychology and behavioral economics, sometimes I
like to dabble in these experiments and see what I can find out about myself.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/">
Myers-Briggs</a> personality type tests is one such test that suggests that I am an
  <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/personality-types">INTJ-A</a> type.
</p>
<p> I can relate to it for the most part. I am inspired by
  pragmatic thinking but I also have an instiable urge to find a deeper
  purpose in all my endevors. </p>
