<b>reading brings catharasis</b>
<p>I seek solace in the works of
luminaries like Bertrand Russel, Ezra Pound, T.S. Elliot, Christopher J. Toole,
Franz Kafka, H.H. Munro (Saki), Dorothy Parker and my most favorite
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Pope">Alexander Pope</a>, who
always took to a brutually honest approach to life; exemplified
by these lines from his epic poem "An Essay on Criticism":
<i>In search of wit these lose their common sense. And then turn critics in their own defence.</i>
